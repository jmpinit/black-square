Objects can be smart enough to store their stories of creation, and to tell them to anyone who asks. In this project the lines for a drawing are turned into sharpie lines on paper by an Axidraw plotter and are also used to generate a web app which shows an animation of the same lines falling onto the paper. The drawing itself is an AR marker so when it is viewed through the web application the virtual lines are seen falling onto the physical drawing.

The name is inspired by Malevich's Black Square painting.
